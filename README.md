This extension adds 2 new permissions to the admin panel:

- Edit first own post forever
- Edit any own post forever

The two permissions can be tag-scoped.
The permissions are separate from "Allow post editing" and are not effected by its value.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-post-permissions

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
